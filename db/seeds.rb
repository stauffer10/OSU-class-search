I took it knowing very little python or programming, and found it to be really quite easy. I found the optional text (which can be downloaded as free PDF or purchased inexpensively as a paperback) to be a wonderful extension and secondary resource. Weekly assignments are short (too short, I would say), and quizzes were open-internet and allowed for a retake. I took the quizzes first and used them to help guide what I looked at as I reviewed the weekly lessons on Canvas. Instructor clearly wants everyone to have reasonable shot at 100% on quizzes, based on this setup. Quiz items are randomized from a larger problem set, and the quiz answer options are randomized as well, so you do have to focus on actually learning the ideas. The instructor introduces git on week one, and assignments are submitted through GitHub. However, the true power of git becomes apparent during weeks 8, 9, and 10, when the projects become long enough to warrant branching and merging. Try to remember that git is your friend when you get there. You can do some early studying via Udemy or other Python resources if you like, but it is not at all required. People who come in knowing Python are actually at a sort of disadvantage: we are forbidden from using non-covered topics and tools, and some Piazza/Slack convos were complaints about Why can't I use function.method()??

    reviews_content: "I found this course really interesting and the topics covered are SUPER useful and important for pretty much every other class, especially Algorithms. The provided lectures and material are pretty poor so make sure you do whatever is necessary to understand what's being talked about. The concepts covered in this class are fundamental to lots of programming so it's easy to find outside resources.",

    reviews_content: "The only concepts from C that you might not have covered in earlier classes were void pointers and function pointers - these will come up in the last quarter of the class. No need to do any specialized C prep. The most valuable things you can do to keep a good grade are (in order of importance): 1. Join a group early via slack, preferably before class starts. The students forming groups then will be the most motivated, and will help push you when you start getting lazy halfway through. 2. Create an implementation of each data structure from each worksheet along with unit tests. This will end up being a lot of work (10 hours per week, and more when doing AVL Trees/Heaps) since there are generally 5 worksheets per week. Your own C implementations internalize the structures/code so that you can answer questions on the exams that you might not have done before (if you don't Leetcode). Generally, exam coding questions will be something from the worksheets but with a twist. 3. Leetcode practice targeting each data structure is a fantastic supplement to the worksheets and their implementations - this will really help on the exam coding questions. It seems like it's easy to get a bad grade. Lots of students complained about the exam difficulty, but I'm not sure what kind of prep they did. I feel like doing these three things (and staying on it) helped earn an easy 97% final grade. ",
